# 🫧 Dynamic bubbles

This is an interactive 3D experience where users can explore a scene filled with dynamic, iridescent bubbles that react to user input and environmental settings. The scene includes floating text and bubbles that gently drift and change position, creating a soothing and visually appealing atmosphere. Users can tweak various material properties of the bubbles, including transmission, iridescence, and metalness, through an interactive GUI.
